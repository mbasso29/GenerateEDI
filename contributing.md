Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub
Set up Git
Collaborating with pull requests

Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

Make Changes


Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
