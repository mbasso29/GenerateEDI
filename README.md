# GenerateEDI

This application is meant to generate the X12 EDI files used with HIPAA applications.

In my experience, QAs can greatly benefit from being able to generate their own "mock" EDI files for testing purposes so, this application will allow for users to generate their EDI files with any information that is required to generate an EDI file and import or upload to their application for testing purposes. 

This will also be an OPEN SOURCE application to allow for other developers to continue and for the application to be free of charge for companies to use for testing.

In this file, you will be able to select a type of HIPAA EDI file that will automatically choose the right file format for the generated file.

After selecting the type of file, the user will enter the values needed to be in the EDI file, select a location on their computer to save the file and then generate the file.

Once this is completed, users will have the EDI file desired to import, upload, or whatever they need to do in order to use the file for testing in their applications.
