# GenerateEDI

This application is meant to generate the X12 EDI files used with HIPAA applications.

In my experience, QAs can greatly benefit from being able to generate their own "mock" EDI files for testing purposes so, this application will allow for users to generate their EDI files with any information that is required to generate an EDI file and import or upload to their application for testing purposes. 

This will also be an OPEN SOURCE application to allow for other developers to continue and for the application to be free of charge for companies to use for testing.
